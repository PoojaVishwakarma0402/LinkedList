Intuition
The problem involves rotating a linked list to the right by a certain number of positions. My initial thoughts are to find the length of the linked list, calculate the effective rotation, and then perform the rotation by updating the pointers.

Approach
First, handle base cases:

If the linked list is empty (head == NULL), return the original head.
If there's only one node in the linked list (head->next == NULL), or if the rotation count is zero, no rotation is needed, so return the original head.
Find the length of the linked list and calculate the effective rotation (k = k % len), where len is the length of the linked list.

Make the linked list circular by connecting the tail to the head.

Move to the node just before the new head position (len - k - 1 steps from the current head) and update the pointers accordingly.

The new head is the next node after the current tail. Set the tail's next pointer to NULL to break the circular structure.

Return the new head of the rotated linked list.

Complexity
Time complexity:
Time complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the linked list twice, once to find its length and once to perform the rotation.

Space complexity:
Space complexity: O(1), as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

Code
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * struct ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode *next;
 *     ListNode() : val(0), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x) : val(x), next(nullptr) {}
 *     ListNode(int x, ListNode *next) : val(x), next(next) {}
 * };
 */

class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* rotateRight(ListNode* head, int k) {
       if(head==NULL || head->next== NULL || k==0) return head;
       
       ListNode *tail=head;
       int len=1;
       while(tail->next!=NULL){
           len++;
           tail=tail->next;
       }
       k=k%len;
       tail->next=head;
       tail=head;
       for(int i=0;i<len-k-1;i++){
           tail=tail->next;
       }
       head=tail->next;
       tail->next=NULL;
       return head;
        
    }
};
